AD) The ruins of an ancient Roman building built under Augustus. The so-called Temple of Diana is located near the gushing spring of \"La Fontaine\", around which was an Augusteum, a sanctuary devoted to the cult of the emperor and his family, centred on a nymphaeum. Its basilica-like floor plan argues against it being a temple and there is no archaeological or literary evidence for its dedication to Diana. The building may instead have been a library. Its facade was rebuilt during the 2nd century and in the mediaeval era it housed a monastery, ensuring its survival. Its roof construction consists of several elaborate thick barrel-vaulted rooms, using carefully cut ashlars supporting an upper floor. Partly dug into the side of Mount Cavalier, the building was originally flanked by annexes. The main facade is pierced by three large arches.<br>Medium: <br>Twitter: <br>TikTok: <br>YouTube:",
